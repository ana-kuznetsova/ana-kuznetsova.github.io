            <h3>Discrete encoder representations for ASR</h3>
            <p>Discrete audio and semantic tokens inspired by large language models gained popularity
                not only in natural language processing but also in speech and audio applications. 
                The potential of neural codecs and semantic SSL representations has been vastly explored
                for reducing the training complexity of a variety of the downstream tasks.
                However, for the transmission and 
                communication scenarios, when the ASR system is deployed on the edge devices, the bitrate 
                of the speech tokens is of the utmost importance. In this project, we explore the lower bound 
                of the bitrate of the discrete representations for ASR systems without loss of the recognition
                accuracy. To save the space on device and reduce the transmission latency, we propose quantization
                method for the ASR encoder.

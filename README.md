This is a personal page and blog of Anastasia Kuznetsova, PhD student at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am conducting research in speech processing realm of deep learning, exploring the applications of Reinforcement Learning in Speech Enhancement and Speech Recognition.

### What is this blog about?
There's not much here at this point since I have just started developing the concept of this website. But I am planning to publish short blog posts and paper summaries on recent advances in **speech enhancement** and **speech recognition**, make short but informative write ups on RL algorithms in a very comprehensive manner as well as include my own insights and achievements in this area.

This is a personal page and blog of Anastasia Kuznetsova, PhD student at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am conducting research in speech processing realm of deep learning, exploring the applications of Reinforcement Learning in Speech Enhancement and Speech Recognition.

### What is this blog about?
This page is quite fresh, so not much content here so far. By writing this blog I pursue two main goals:

* Keep the track of the on going research in Speech Enhancement and ASR that leverages Reinforcement Learning algorithms. I will keep the updated bibliography and post short summaries (or slides) of the articles I've recently read.
 
* Explain RL algorithms and ideas in a simple and concise manner so that anyone with no background in RL could understand the principles of RL frameworks.

Hi, my name is Anastasia and I am the second year PhD student in Computer Science and Computational Linguisitcs at Indiana University, Bloomington. My research mainly is focused on *Reinforcement learning* techniques and algorithms in speech processing applications.

I am a part of *[Aspire](https://aspire.sice.indiana.edu/)* research group organized by Prof. Donald Williamson and *Inclusive technology for marginalized languages* (ITML) laboratory mentored by Prof. Francis Tyers here at IU.

There's not much here at this point since I have just started developing the concept of this website. But I am planning to publish short blog posts and paper summaries on recent advances in **speech enhancement** and **speech recognition**, make short but informative write ups on RL algorithms in a very comprehensive manner as well as include my own insights and achievements in this area.

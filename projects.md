### Current Projects

#### Reinforcement Learning based Speech Enhancement

Ongoing project explores the possibilities of exploiting RL algorithms in speech enhancement area inlow-data setting. Current phase involves implementation and testing of the existing RL-based speechdenoising techniques from published papers.

#### Collecting Guarani Speech Corpus for Common Voice

*[Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en)* is Mozilla's inclusive open source initiative for collecting speech data involving most widely spoken languages as well as low resource languages. At the moment I am coordinating contributors and open source community to create a data set for Paraguayan Guarani. I am collecting the corpus of sententes written in Guarani which will be recorded. 

The end results of the project will be the first publically available speech-to-text Guarani model.

#### A reinforcement-learning approach to curriculum generation for ASR

The project suggests an approach to mitigate the lack of training data by employing an Automated Curriculum Learning paradigm in combination with bandit approach inspired by the reinforcement learning domain. The implemented bandit framework shows a 10% WER and 27% CER improvementover the baseline model and the potential of the further investigation of RL algorithms in ASR.

#### BPE weighting of morphological analyser for Paraguayan Guarani

Weighting of the morphological analyser based on finite-state technology using Byte Pair encodingalgorithm.

### Past projects
-----
#### Machine Translation for Guaraniâ€“Spanish language pair 

This project was completed during *Google Summer of Code* program for machine translation open source platform  *[Apertium](https://github.com/apertium)* focusing on under-resourced and marginalized languages.

The project includes the construction of FST-based morphological analyser, Guarani-Spanish bilingual dictionary (bidix) and Transfer rules (see full [report](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/User:Anakuznetsova/GSOC_2018_Guarani_Spanish)).

One of the main components of the system is morphological analyser achieved coverage of 89% and 90% on two open source corpora.

#### Named Entity Recognition for Russian Popular Science corpora

Rule-based entity extraction using Tomita parser. I leveraged corpora manually annotated with the names of the scientists and wrote the rules achieving 0.48 accuracy in rigid time constraints.


#### Morphological Disambiguation for Paraguayan Guarani

Morphological disambiguation task is completed by using rule-based technology (ConstraintGrammar formaism).

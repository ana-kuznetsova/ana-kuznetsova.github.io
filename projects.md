#### Machine Translation for Guaraniâ€“Spanish language pair 

This project was completed during *Google Summer of Code* program for machine translation open source platform  *[Apertium](https://github.com/apertium)* focusing on under-resourced and marginalized languages.

The project includes the construction of FST-based morphological analyser, Guarani-Spanish bilingual dictionary (bidix) and Transfer rules (see full [report](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/User:Anakuznetsova/GSOC_2018_Guarani_Spanish)).

One of the main components of the system is morphological analyser achieved coverage of 89% and 90% on two open source corpora.

#### Named Entity Recognition for Russian Popular Science corpora

Rule-based entity extraction using Tomita parser. I leveraged corpora manually annotated with the names of the scientists and wrote the rules achieving 0.48 accuracy in rigid time constraints.
